## üìù Notes
- All services follow interface-based design for easy swapping
- OAuth2 currently supports only Google, but architecture allows easy addition of other providers
- Email service uses SMTP but can be swapped for services like SendGrid
- AI service uses Gemini but supports multiple providers through abstraction
- Rate limiting is memory-based; consider Redis for production
